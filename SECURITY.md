## 📜 Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Always use dry-run mode first**
   \`\`\`bash
   sudo ./sysmaint --dry-run
   \`\`\`

2. **Verify script integrity before execution**
   \`\`\`bash
   sha256sum sysmaint
   \`\`\`

3. **Run with least privilege necessary**
   \`\`\`bash
   # Avoid running as full root when possible
   sudo ./sysmaint --non-interactive
   \`\`\`

4. **Review logs for suspicious activity**
   \`\`\`bash
   # JSON output for automated monitoring
   sudo ./sysmaint --json | jq .
   \`\`\`

5. **Keep systems updated**
   \`\`\`bash
   # Regular security updates
   sudo ./sysmaint --update-only
   \`\`\`

### For Developers

1. **Follow secure coding practices**
   - Validate all input parameters
   - Use set -e for error handling
   - Quote all variables
   - Avoid eval statements

2. **Test changes thoroughly**
   - Run ShellCheck on all code
   - Test on multiple distributions
   - Verify dry-run mode accuracy

3. **Document security considerations**
   - Comment on security-sensitive code
   - Update SECURITY.md for changes
   - Document any new permissions required
